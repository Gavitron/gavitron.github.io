## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Gavitron/gavitron.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Gavitron/gavitron.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

# The Hacker-Blog theme

*Hacker-Blog is a minimalistic, responsive jekyll theme built for hackers. It is based on the [hacker theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker) for project pages.*

Demo: [https://ashishchaudhary.in/hacker-blog](https://ashishchaudhary.in/hacker-blog)

### Included

2. Customize your blog
3. Add a new post in `_posts/` directory with proper name format (as shown in placeholder posts)
4. Commit and push to master 

## Local Build

If you want to see the changes before pushing the blog to Github, do a local build.

1. [`gem install jekyll`](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#install-with-rubygems)
2. `gem install jekyll-seo-tag`
3. (`cd` to the blog directory, then:) `jekyll serve --watch --port 8000`
4. Go to `http://0.0.0.0:8000/` in your web browser.

*Note: In case you have set a `baseurl` different than `/` in `_config.yml`, go to `http://0.0.0.0:8000/BASEURL/` instead.*

### Local build using docker

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 \
  --volume="LOCATION_OF_YOUR_JEKYLL_BLOG:/srv/jekyll" \
  -it tocttou/jekyll:3.5 \
  jekyll serve --watch --port 8000
```

Replace `LOCATION_OF_YOUR_JEKYLL_BLOG` with the full path of your blog repository. Visit `http://localhost:8000/` to access the blog.

*Note: In case you have set a `baseurl` different than `/` in `_config.yml`, go to `http://0.0.0.0:8000/BASEURL/` instead.*
